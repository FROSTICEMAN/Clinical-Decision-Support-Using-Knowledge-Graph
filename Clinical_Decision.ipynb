      "3. Encourage the patient to rest and stay hydrated.\n",

      "5. Consider antiviral medications for the patient if they are at higher risk for complications. These medications can reduce the severity and duration of flu symptoms if started within 48 hours of symptom onset.\n",
      "6. Remind the patient to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and to wash their hands frequently to prevent spreading the flu to others.\n",
      "7. Keep the patient away from others as much as possible, especially those who are at higher risk for flu complications.\n",
